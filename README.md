Welcome to Patrol Manager. This is a tool for fivem communites to allow their members to easily fill their patrol logs. This project was made with React, and Electron. As well as I went with a local json-server as it's meant for a single user, and eliminates the worry for secruity worry. No one else can access your data or fill patrol logs on your behalf.

**Installation Directions:
1. Install the exe.
2. run the exe after installation
3. close the installtion exe
4. download "Community.json" from your respective community ( you can only have one community at a time. This may change in the future ).
5. Place the json file in your "C:\usernamehere\AppData\Local\patrol_manager"
6. run the application. Do not run the setup exe or the above will need to be done again.
