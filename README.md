Welcome to Patrol Manager. This is a tool for fivem communites to allow their members to easily fill their patrol logs. This project was made with React, and Electron. As well as I went with a local json-server as it's meant for a single user, and eliminates the worry for secruity worry. No one else can access your data or fill patrol logs on your behalf.
